# Design_and_Analysis_of_Experiments
Jupyter notebooks with an introduction to the Design and Analysis of Experiments including simple python (Pandas) exercises. 
Authored with some reference to Field and Hole (2003)  "How to design and report experiments", Sage publishing.
The material is produced to be used for the BSc course for Medialogy students at Aalborg University, but I hope it will be useful
also as a general intro /recap for others. 
The scope is not to give an in-depth overview of the topic or pandas, but to introduce some of the theory and also involve the student to 
reflect on why some things need to be taken into account when planning data collection.
