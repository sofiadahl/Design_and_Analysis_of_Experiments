# Design_and_Analysis_of_Experiments
Jupyter notebooks with an introduction to the Design and Analysis of Experiments including simple python (Pandas) exercises. 
Authored with some reference to Field and Hole (2003)  "How to design and report experiments", Sage publishing but expanding somewhat beyond the topic.
The material is produced to be used for the BSc course for Medialogy students at Aalborg University, but I hope it will be useful
also as a general intro /recap for others. It is also possible to run the code without specific installation using colab https://colab.research.google.com/github/sofiadahl/Design_and_Analysis_of_Experiments/blob/main/ 

The aim is to

    - give an introduction to concepts and methods important in experimental design and statistical analysis of data
    - be brief enough to be useful as a first reference point and re-cap to students of media technology

The topic is covered in the following notebooks:

    DAE 1 Variables
    DAE 2 Designing Experiments
    DAE 3 Measuring Validity and Reliability
    DAE 4 Descriptive Statistics
    DAE 5 Correlation and Linear Regression
    DAE 6 Inferential Statistics
    DAE 7 Parametric Data
    DAE 8 Student t-test
    DAE 9 ANOVA
    DAE 10 Non-parametric tests

It is my hope that after going through the book and exercises, you should feel confident enough to pick up a book on statistics, and work out what type of measurement instruments and analysis that are appropriate to use for a particular evaluation.  

It should be possible to follow and do most of the "think-and-do" try outs without particular skills in python or mathematics.
For those that would like a brief introduction to Python please check out software-carpentry https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/ and the quick intro to pandas, https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/10min.html?highlight=randint.

Thanks to Prithvi Kantan for proofreading, helpful comments and suggestions.
