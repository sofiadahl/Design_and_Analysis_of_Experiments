    "## 1. Multiple comparisons\n",
    "We frequently have more than two conditions we want to compare. For instance we might want to investigate guitarists preferesnces for guitar effects in a factorial design, where we might choose to compare 2 reverb settings x 3 levels of expertise (perhaps measured by Gold MSI).\n",
    "\n",
    "Technically, we can compare for effects with pairwise comparisons using t-tests but it is a bad idea. The probability of  making a type I error is 5\\%  ($\\alpha$ =.05) for *each* test. The more comparisons we make, the higher the risk of finding a significant difference purely by chance\n",
    "\n",
    "If three experimental groups have sample means from the same distributions, that is if $\\mu_1$ = $\\mu_2$ =$\\mu_3$, we need to make three pairwise comparisons (1 versus 2, 2 versus 3, and 1 versus 3). The probability  of NO  Type I error is $(0.95)^3=0.86$ ($\\alpha$ =.05). That is, the probability of making *at least* one Type I error when doing these three comparisons is $1-0.86=0.14$, or 14\\%. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two commonly used ways to get around this problem. If multiple t-tests are used, the $\\alpha$-level can be adjusted so that each test is more strictly performed. Typically such a *Bonferroni* correction is used to compensate for the increased probability of Type I errors when doing multiple t-tests. But a better approach is to do ONE test that looks for an overall effect, and drop all the pairwise comparisons being the source of the increased Type I error risk. This is what ANOVA does."

    "### 1.1. ANOVA\n",
    "\n",
    "A better approach is to perform one test that includes all categories and factors at once. A very commonly used test is Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). There are many different kinds of ANOVAs, those that are intended for repeated measurements and multiple factors (for instance, there might be several levels of auditory and visual feedback in the example above, or perhaps you would like to include the age and handedness as a factor that might influence performance). The general principle, however, is to compare the variance between different groups (i.e. conditions or  treatments) with the variance occurring within each group.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$F  =\\frac {variance -between - treatments} {variance - within-  treatments} =\\frac {variance_{explained}} {variance_{unexplained}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Hopefully the talk of variance now rings a bell, because again the sum of squares are at the basis of these calculations. In the Inferental chapter we calculated the effect size from the ratio between the model $ SS_M$ and the total $SS_T$ sum of squares. The F statistic is essentially ratio between the explained variance of the model $SS_{M}$ and the residual variance $SS_{Res}$:\n",
    "$$\\frac {SS_{M}} {SS_{Res}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The model in the case of ANOVA is a bit more complex in that we typically have more means than two to do the sum of squares for (one for each treatment /group). Because we calculate this for the full model at once, the test itself cannot say if ALL or just ONE of the groups differ significantly. For this we need to make follow-up comparisons that *contrasts* the different groups (just as you would in t-tests). These contrast tests can be *planned* already at the start of the experiment, or *post-hoc*, after the ANOVA has been run. In both cases, precautions againt multiple tests have to be taken, for instance by dividing the significance level by the number of tests done as (Bonferroni correction). \n",
    "\n",
    "So when reporting results from an ANOVA, we would both report the results from the overall test on the full model, but also the results of the follow-up pairwise comparisons. Some software reports these contrasts, perhaps even using different tests. Which ones to report depend a bit. \n"

To investigate this, we add and additional independent variable \"Instrument\" where participants were recruited among different groups of instrumentalists. If we include three controllers and three different instrumentalists we would have a 2-way ANOVA. In addition to any *main effect* of instrument group or controller, it is also likely that we would like to investigate the  *interaction effects* where there is effect of the controller and instrument *combined*.
